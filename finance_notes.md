##  Python for Finance

Financial tradition to work with rolling statistics... rolling min, mean, max, etc.....
Used in technical analysis of stocks .... Two simple moving averages is an old strategy

log returns/ log forms are used alot, in addition... pct return, not absolute returns are used 
    Log returns are frequently used in finance because they offer a more accurate and mathematically tractable measure of investment performance, especially over longer periods, and they are time-additive, meaning the total return is simply the sum of the individual period returns. 

SMA (Simple moving average) trading rule
Go long (= +1) when the shorter SMA is above the longer SMA.
Go short (= -1) when the shorter SMA is below the longer SMA
